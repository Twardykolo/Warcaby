Ok so that project is probably the ugliest code I've wrote so far.
Before you venture into it, make sure you have some holy water at hand to wash your eyeballs.

The game has a lot of issues. Many of them are related to Allegro5 library. For example it can read mouse position at x=654547 and y=645873 in a 800x800 
window when alt + tabing.

Also function names are in Polish and are using letters like "ą,ć,ż" so that's gonna make the code unreadable.
